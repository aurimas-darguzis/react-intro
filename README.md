# A Complete Intro to React
 
Welcome to a complete intro to React! 

This project was created by following Brian Holt workshop. The workshop material can be found [here][gh-page]. On the master branch you will find the completed project. On the start branch you will find the barebones boilerplate of the project designed to help you get started.

## Contributing

Please contribute, file issues, and make PRs. More than anything I'm sure there are typos abounding.
